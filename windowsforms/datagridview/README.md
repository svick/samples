# DataGridView Samples
This Windows Forms sample was ported to .NET Core from 
[a previous .NET Framework 4.5 sample](https://code.msdn.microsoft.com/windowsdesktop/CSWinFormDataGridView-29783221).

This sample demonstrates DataGridView usage in a .NET Core 3 WinForms app. 
It contains five separate sample DataGridView scenarios. Uncomment the one 
you wish to run in `Program.cs`:

* CustomDataGridViewColumn
* DataGridViewPaging
* EditingControlHosting
* JustInTimeDataLoading
* MultipleLayeredColumnHeader

Note that the DataGridViewPaging and JustInTimeDataLoading samples use the 
NorthWind sample database (in order to have a large amount of data to display 
in the grid view). Before running these scenarios, follow the 
[these instructions](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/framework/data/adonet/sql/linq/downloading-sample-databases) 
to set up the NorthView sample database and make sure that the connection 
strings in those scenarios are updated to match where the sample database 
is deployed (possibly replacing `localhost` with `(LocalDb)\MSSQLLocalDB`, 
for example).
